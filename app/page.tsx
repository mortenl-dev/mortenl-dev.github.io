        <p>
          I am a 19-year old Software engineering student at SDU SÃ¸nderborg.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting with basic projects in C#, I have gained a fair bit of experience in software development in the past two years by myself.
          Feel free to take a look at my Projects page to get an insight into the work I've done thus far.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to reach out to me, I'd love to get a message on any of the social media platforms I have linked below.
